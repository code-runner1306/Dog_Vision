# Dog Breed Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning application that uses TensorFlow and the MobileNetV2 architecture to analyze an image of a dog and predict its breed. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned to achieve accurate predictions. The repository contains a single Google Colab notebook that documents all the steps taken to create the trained model, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Features
- **Image Input:** Analyze an uploaded image of a dog.
- **Breed Prediction:** The model processes the image and predicts the dog's breed.
- **Efficient Model:** Utilizes MobileNetV2, a lightweight and effective deep learning architecture.
- **Reproducibility:** Detailed implementation steps provided in the Colab notebook.

## Technologies Used
- **Framework:** TensorFlow
- **Model Architecture:** MobileNetV2
- **Development Platform:** Google Colab

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-breed-prediction.git
   cd dog-breed-prediction
   ```

2. **Open the Colab Notebook:**
   - Navigate to the `dog_breed_prediction.ipynb` file.
   - Open it in Google Colab.

3. **Follow the Notebook Steps:**
   - Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

4. **Predict Dog Breeds:**
   - Use the trained model to analyze dog images and predict their breeds.

## Model Details
- **Base Model:** MobileNetV2
- **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tuned on a dataset of dog breeds.
- **Input Size:** The model expects input images resized to 224x224 pixels.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for predicting breeds in images with multiple dogs.
- Extend the model to identify mixed-breed dogs.
