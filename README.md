# Dog Breed Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning application that uses TensorFlow and the MobileNetV2 architecture to analyze an image of a dog and predict its breed. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Image Input:** Upload an image of a dog.
- **Breed Prediction:** The model analyzes the image and predicts the breed of the dog.
- **Fast and Efficient:** Utilizes MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient deep learning model.

## Technologies Used
- **Framework:** TensorFlow
- **Model Architecture:** MobileNetV2
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (if applicable)
- **Backend:** Python (if applicable)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-breed-prediction.git
   cd dog-breed-prediction
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pre-Trained Model:**
   - Ensure you have the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model weights.
   - Place the weights file in the appropriate directory (e.g., `models/`).

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (if a web interface is included).

## Usage
- Upload an image of a dog through the application interface.
- The model will process the image and display the predicted breed.
- Optionally, view additional details like confidence scores.

## Model Details
- **Base Model:** MobileNetV2
- **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tuned on a dataset of dog breeds.
- **Input Size:** The model expects input images resized to 224x224 pixels.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multi-dog images.
- Expand the model to predict mixed breeds.
- Enhance the web interface for a better user experience.
